Summary: 
Java does not support multiple inheritance because, whenever there is method that have same  signature or 
attributes with same name in both superclasses, java won’t decide which class  method or class attribute to 
implement or which class method and class attributes gets the priority. So Java does not simplify support
 multiple inheritance due to that confusion occurs when attributes or methods  from the superclasses have same 
 signature.
