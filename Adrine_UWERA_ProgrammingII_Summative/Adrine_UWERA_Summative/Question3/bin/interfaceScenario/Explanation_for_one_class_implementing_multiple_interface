Summary:
Java supports multiple implementation of interfaces because only abstract methods whose implementations is done
by the subclasses. And since, the methods of interfaces have no body, their implementations won’t be associated
with complication issues as there is in multiple inheritance (e.g. not determining what class method to 
inherit when superclasses have method with same signature). Also, a class implements an interface to add 
functionalities to the class i.e a class can implement many interfaces to gain all the functionalities 
needed by the class.
